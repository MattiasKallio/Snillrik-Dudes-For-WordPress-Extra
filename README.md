# Snillrik Dudes For WordPress Extra
My fancy plugin Snillrik Dudes for WordPress is intended for adding and displaying people, coworkers, team, members etc on your page. You can read more about how it works below. 
The pluign is built to be extended, so this is for adding extra ways to display the dudes. Maybe you have a design and want's to use that instead of the default ones. 

So you have to have the plugin first, but then there's a set of filter-functions and css to add new looks and an example for template. 

### Looks
#### As filter / hook in functions etc.
Put the php-code in functions.php (it can be in and own plugin or other places too, but most likley you will want it to be in functions.php)
Put the CSS where CSS goes, so either a css file or in the customizer for the template.

#### As a folder in theme 
Put a folder containg a php-file and a css file in your themes root folder ie my-theme/snillrik-dudes/custom-dude.
there is an example under looks called another-look.

### Template
The template gos in a folder called snillrik-dudes and is called singel_dude.php
CSS for your new template goes where css goes the same way as looks.

# Shut up and take my money?
